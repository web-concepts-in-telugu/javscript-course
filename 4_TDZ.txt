Temporal Dead Zone

Temporal Dead Zone is a behaviour that occurs with variables declared using let and const keywords. 
It is a behaviour where we try to access a variable before it is initialized.

Examples of temporal dead zone:

x = 23; // Gives reference error

let x;

function anotherRandomFunc(){
  message = "Hello"; // Throws a reference error

  let message;
}

anotherRandomFunc();

In the code above, both in the global scope and functional scope, 
we are trying to access variables that have not been declared yet. This is called the Temporal Dead Zone.
