Functions

- A set of statements that performs a task;

Defining functions
 
 1. Function declarations

    A function declaration consists of the function keyword, followed by:
        - The name of the function.
        - A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
        - The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, { /* â€¦ */ }

    example: 
    
    function square(number) {
        return number * number;
    }
    square(4)


 2. Function expressions
    
    Function expressions are anonymous functions; it does not have to have a name.
    But we can assign it to a variable.

    For example, the function square could have been defined as:

    const square = function (number) {
        return number * number;
    };

    console.log(square(4)); // 16
